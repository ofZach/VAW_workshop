  Onset detection driver

  The following routines compute the onset detection function and detect peaks
  in these functions. When onsets are found above a given silence threshold,
  and after a minimum inter-onset interval, the output vector returned by
  aubio_onset is filled with 1. Otherwise, the output vector remains 0.

  The peak-picking threshold, the silence threshold, and the minimum
  inter-onset interval can be adjusted during the execution of the aubio_onset
  routine using the corresponding functions.
