  Infinite Impulse Response filter

  This file implements IIR filters of any order:
 
  \f$ y[n] = b_1 x[n] + ... + b_{order} x[n-order] -
       a_2 y[n-1] - ... - a_{order} y[n-order]\f$

  The filtfilt version runs the filter twice, forward and backward, to
  compensate the phase shifting of the forward operation.
